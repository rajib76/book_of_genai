**Create an account in open ai and craft a prompt for the below scenario.**

**Scenario:**
You work as a product manager for a popular e-commerce platform. Your role involves improving the user experience and ensuring customer satisfaction. One of your key objectives is to analyze customer reviews of products listed on your platform to identify areas for improvement and deliver a seamless shopping experience.

**Goal:**
Your task is to leverage Generative AI to create a prompt that can take unstructured customer reviews as input and generate structured responses. These responses should provide valuable insights to help improve product listings and enhance the overall shopping experience. The structured response should include the date of the review, the product being reviewed, the user's rating, a concise summary (up to 100 words) of the review content, key suggestions for product improvement, any mentions of competing products, and an overall sentiment analysis (positive, negative, or neutral).

**Use the below reviews for Testing:**

**Sample-1**
[2023-11-05] - rating 4/5 - I recently purchased the TechMaster Pro headphones, and I must say, they have exceeded my expectations. The sound quality is outstanding, providing rich and immersive audio for my music and movies. However, there's room for improvement in the comfort department. After extended use, the ear cushions start to feel a bit uncomfortable, and I wish they were softer. Additionally, it would be great to see more color options for these headphones. Despite these minor issues, I'm quite satisfied with my purchase. When comparing them to the SoundWave Elite headphones, the TechMaster Pro offers superior sound quality, but the comfort aspect could use some enhancements. Overall, a positive experience, and I recommend them to fellow music enthusiasts.

**Sample-2**
[2023-11-15] - rating 1/5 - I recently ordered the SkyView 4K Ultra HD Smart TV, and I have to say it's been a major disappointment. The product arrived two weeks late, which was frustrating in itself. When I finally got it set up, I was shocked by the poor picture quality. The colors are dull, and there's a noticeable lag when streaming content. It's like watching TV in the Stone Age. To make matters worse, the remote control provided feels flimsy and unresponsive. I had high hopes for this TV, but it has failed to meet even the most basic expectations. In comparison, my friend owns a VisionX 4K Smart TV, and it delivers a stunning viewing experience with vibrant colors and seamless streaming. SkyView needs to step up its game and invest in better display technology and improved customer service. I'm extremely disappointed with this purchase and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
